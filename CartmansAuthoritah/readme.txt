F.A.Q.
============================================================================
Q: I get an error message saying "file is linked to missing export DDRAW.DLL
:DirectDrawCreateEx" 
A: This indicates that you don't have DirectX 7.0 or higher installed on 	
your machine. You will need to download and install the latest version of 
DirectX from Microsoft http://www.microsoft.com/directx/ 

Q: Are there any extra levels or can I make my own levels? 
A: No you cannot make your own levels at this stage. This would require a 
fair amount of my time and effort to enable this and if I decide to add 
support for this then it will be posted on my web site. But this is very
unlikely.

Q: Are you going to make a sequel?
A: Probably not. 

Q: Are there any cheat codes for the game and what are they?
A: See the part above about Version 1.3c

Q: The game runs at a slow frame rate on my PC.
A: This will happen if your graphics cards is a piece of crap!!
